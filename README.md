The web application is hosted [here](https://a-gentlemans-drink.herokuapp.com), using Heroku cloud plataform.

## Built with

The entire project was implemented using just native **JavaScript**, without any framework such as React or Angular, following the MVC design pattern.

The app is powered by the beautiful [The CocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php). Thank you for letting the public use it for free!

## Usage

Due to its simplicity the web application is a Single Page Application.

At the "Header" you are able to perform a search based on Ingredient or Name, after which the search results will be displayed on the left side in pages of 10.

By selecting a cocktail in that list, a full description is open containing the cocktail photo, ingredients, how to prepare it, among others things.

Finally, you can *Favorite* your favorite cocktails by pressing the heart button.
When at least one cocktail is favored, a heart button appears in the "header" opening a list containing your favorite cocktails for quick access.
